# notifyi

This is an app in development to track long running experiments/processes on a computer.

The idea is to have a decentralised system where one can subscribe to certian processes/experiments and can be notifies on your choice of device (Smartphone/PC) that a paticular process is completed/crashed.

This let's us quickly come back to it and fix it. 

I'm just a physicist trying to build something for my convenience so dont @ me.
